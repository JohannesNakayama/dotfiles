# Start sxhkd
# -- NOTE:
# -- Apparently, bspwm starts sxhkd even when you don't specify it
# -- explicitly here in the bspwmrc. With neo2 keyboard layout, this
# -- leads to two instances of sxhkd running so that key bindings for
# -- both work at the same time (which is hugely confusing). This is
# -- because the instance started by bspwm does not include the `-m 1`
# -- flag which is necessary for the keystrokes to be recognized as
# -- neo2 input. Therefore, I first kill all sxhkd instances, wait
# -- until they are all killed, and then start it again with the flag.
# -- This seem a little hacky, though.
